# Quanser Active Suspension System Design (LQR MPC Controller)
## Introduction
This repository contains the code of designing Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Model Predictive Controller (MPC) to achieve desired performance based on Quanser Active Suspension System. The code should be run in MATLAB and Labview.
The finished tasks are as follow:
1. The simulated system model is determined based on the experiment data by using least square method. 
2. LQR and MPC controllers are designed according to three performance specifications: ride comfort, suspension travel and road handling. In addition, the performances of the designed controllers are simulated in Simulink.
3. Implement the designed LQR and MPC controllers on the real Quanser Active Suspension System.
